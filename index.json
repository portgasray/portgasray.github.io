For robotic grasping, the cluttered and self-occlusion scenarios bring new challenges to the this field. Currently, society uses CNNs to solve this problem. The CNN models will suffer high uncertainty caused by the environmental factors and the object itself. These models usually maintain a Gaussian distribution, which is not suitable for the underlying manifold structure of the pose. Many works decouple rotation from the translation and quantify rotational uncertainty. Only a few works pay attention to the uncertainty of the 6D pose. This work proposes a distribution that can capture the uncertainty of the 6D pose parameterized by the dual quaternions, meanwhile, the proposed distribution takes the periodic nature of the underlying structure into account. The presented results include the normalization constant computation and parameter estimation techniques of the distribution. This work shows the benefits of the proposed distribution, which provides a more realistic explanation for the uncertainty in the 6D pose and eliminates the drawback inherited from the planar rigid motion.","tags":[],"title":"A novel distribution for representation of 6D pose uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"[[Radhika Nagpal]] 不认为要有更多的勇气去做，而是本应该去做。It\u0026rsquo;s a dispassion. 相反，要降低奖励，使得风险变低。\n \u0026ldquo;Congratulations.
